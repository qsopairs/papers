JXP:
1.  Stack of BOSS at z_FG Lya (with original file and KG continua)
2.  Stack LRIS
-----
JFH:
1.  Myers QSOs
2.  Develop query code
3.  Merge with private qsos (enigma.new_qsos.db.py + QSO_redshifts.ipynb in enigma)
4.  Run models with a LogLv > 31.2 cutoff. Generate a piece of code that can forward model a stack using
    hooks from JXP's stacking code.
---
    1. Cut on Lyb forest -- Done in qpq_query
    2. Remove true duplicates
3. Confirm MFR continua
  -- Especially for QPQ
  -- Not implemented for QPQ!
4. Decide on how close is too close to the b/g QSO (currently 1200A)
  -- Be consistent with KG's cut
5. Require the continuum cover to +/-1000 km/s from zlya
6. Impose a S/N cut.  Probably 1 per SDSS pixel or so
