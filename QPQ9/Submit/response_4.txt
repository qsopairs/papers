Dear referee,

It's been very helpful to have these exchanges with you. Thank you
very much for your professional service. I have added your latest
suggestions.

We updated the text to be somewhat more quantitative and rigorous.
Anistropic emission is degenerate with intermittent emission.
First we consider the case where the quasar lifetime is infinite, and
the observed asymmetry is only produced by anisotropic emission. Then,
the radial outflow speed needs to be ~450 km/s and the opening
angle needs to be ~180 degrees, so that the observed intrinsic
dispersion and absorption centroid can be produced.
Second we consider the case where the quasar is isotropic, and the
observed asymmetry is only produced by finite lifetime. We further make
the assumption the quasar luminosity is constant during its lifetime.
Then, the radial outflow speed needs to be at least ~420 km/s and the
quasar must have shined for ~0.4e+6 years, to reproduce the observation.
For the anisotropy-only case, the opening angle
deduced is rather large compared to literature findings (e.g.
Borisova+16). For the intermittence-only case, if the quasars are on
averaged observed near the middle of the episode, the lifetime
deduced is somewhat small compared to literature findings. We thus
speculate that the asymmetry is the result of a combination of anisotropic
and intermittent emission. To better illustrate the second case, we also
updated the cartoon figure on finite lifetime to show a scenario where the
emission is isotropic.

We thank the referee for the literature suggestion, and the discussion
suggestion. We have added relevant text.

>1) It would be useful to add minor ticks to Figure 3, particularly on the
>x-axis.

We added minor ticks. We thank the referee's attentiveness to details.

>2) The numbering on the x-axis of Figure 4 is difficult to read
>currently.

We decreased the number of tick labels. We thank the referee for their
attentiveness.
