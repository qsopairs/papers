Editor Walter,

We thank very much the referee for their careful reading of our manuscript, and their comments and criticism.
Following their recommendations, we have revised our manuscript in a number of ways detailed below. We are now
resubmitting to the Astrophysical Journal and ask that you consider it further for publication.

In addition to the changes marked in bold face, all the figures and tables have been updated. The updates are a result
of updated analysis of an enlared, modified sample. Moreover, the section on line-of-sight absorption has been moved
to the Appendix.

suggested additional work in the details to follow.

The distribution of absorbing components in velocity is non-Gaussian for each quasar-host associated system. However,
we have 40 absorption systems for CII analysis, and an even larger number of absorption systems for CIV and MgII
analyses. The number of individual components can only be larger. The central limit theorem applies and the
distribution of all absorbing components should tend toward Gaussian distribution. A component-by-component analysis
requires echellette or echelle resolution, which is a criterion for the QPQ8 sample. For this current work, we stack
spectra of all resolutions. Text has been added to explain the above and to refer the readers to specific figures in
QPQ8.

>3) Insufficient detail on the doublet fitting is provided, and uncertainty due to degeneracy between doublet ratio and
>velocity centroid are not addressed.

We allowed the doublet ratio to vary from 2:1 to 1:1. The centroids of the doublets are tied at a fixed separation.
More text has been added.

>4) The conclusions of the paper are not self-consistent. In particular, the authors find that the velocity dispersion
>in the mean stack does not require addition motion (beyond gravitational and cosmological), but the explanation for
>the centroid offset requires that the gas is, on average, flowing away from the quasar host galaxy. This discrepancy
>needs to be addressed.

We acknowledge that we did not present the best argument. The centroid offset does not require that the gas is
flowing away from the galaxy. In our Monte Carlo simulations, we are able to reproduce the centroid offset by assuming
that the gas is all ionized within a certain opening angle. For an opening angle >= 120 degrees, The stack of mock
spectra has amplitude, dispersion, and centroid offset all within 2 times the modeling error. Text has been added to
explain the above. We do not present a new figure to show this stack, since our primary goal of performing Monte Carlo
simulations is to reproduce the dispersion. We have removed the outward arrows in the cartoon figure and the estimates
in radial velocities under an outflow scenario. While outflows cannot be ruled out, we prefer to focus on the argument
that outflows are not required.

>5) Several papers in the literature that are cited are mis-represented.

We have studied the papers more carefully, and have modified the text to represent the literature more correctly.
Details to follow below.

>Additional details on each of the points as well as more minor issues are given below, After this, my referee report
>concludes with a discussion of more minor points.

>Major point 1: quasar systemic redshift measurements
>
>The authors compile a foreground quasar sample by combining quasars with redshifts measured in their own spectra with
>quasars from the SDSS with redshift measurements from the literature. Very little information is provided on how these
>redshifts are measured and the reader is referred to previous QPQ papers. Given the importance of accurate redshifts

We have added text to explain how redshifts are measured. We acknowledge the confusion in calling the line-centering
algorithm a centroiding method. Our algorithm calculates the mode of a line given by (3*median - 2*mean), applied to
the upper 60% of the emission line. Shen+16 states that difference between the peak and the centroid is not
significant, except for the broad line Hbeta, which we did not use in redshift measurements. We have further obtained
individual measurements of centroids and peaks in Shen+16 thru private communication. There is essentially no
difference between using the centroid versus using the peak for [OIII], and there is about 50 km/s
difference for MgII on average. We may expect the difference between a mode and a peak is even smaller.

In the first version of the submitted manuscript, there are two redshift measurement techniques in the z ~ 2 sample:
our custom line-centering algorithm, and the algorithm of Hewett&Wild10. We thank the referee for scrutinizing the
redshift measurement techniques, which helps strengthen our results. In this re-submitted manuscript, for all z > 1.6
sample we measure redshifts of all quasars using our own custom line-centering algorithm instead of adopting values
from Hewett&Wild10. After we purge the quasars whose redshift measurement is dominated by CIII], we find that on
average there is essentially no difference between the Hewett&Wild10 redshifts and our own measured redshifts.
Furthermore, Shen+16 has stated throughout the paper that their work is consistent with Hewett&Wild10 on redshift
estimates based on MgII emission and on the average systemic bias. Therefore, for the z ~ 1 sample, where either the
[OIII] or the MgII emission has good data quality, and where we do not measure an intriguing asymmetry in the average
absorption, we continue to adopt the Hewett&Wild10 redshifts.

We have explained in the text that, our results cannot be severely biased by [OIII] redshifts. We have tried
replacing the [OIII] redshifts by MgII or Halpha redshifts, and found a similar centroid and dispersion in the stack.
MgII and Halpha are broader, but it has not been reported in any literature that they are more asymmetric.

>Major point 2:
>
>In Lau et al. 2016, the distribution of absorbing components about the quasar systemic redshift is non-Guassian and
>exhibits broad wings that contain significant portion of the optical depth at large velocities. In a mean stack, these
>wings can be suppressed so that the dispersion of the stacked absorption profile does not represent the actual

>(Prochaska et al. 2014) and individual component measurements (Lau et al. 2016). It should therefore be
>straight-forward to measure the actual velocity distribution of absorption systems around quasars directly rather than
>relying on stacked measurements. The authors should include such a histogram in the revised paper.

As explained above, we have sufficient number of absorbing components that they should tend toward a Gaussian
distribution in the stack. We are able to model the stack by a Gaussian multiplied to a pseudocontinuum. Our visual
inspection does not hint at a broader component in the stack. QPQ7 reported the redshift of the strongest Lya
absorption within the search window. The QPQ7 sample has spectra of all resolutions. It requires echellette or
echelle resolution to identify the metal-associated absorbers. In QPQ8, a scatter plot of the optical depth weighted
centroid of the absorption systems is shown. In the Appendix of QPQ8, the absorption profiles of the individual
components are shown. We have counted 6 of them are at negative velocities, while 15 of them are at positive
velocities. text have been added to reflect these numbers.

>Major point 3:
>
>The authors do not provide enough detail regarding the fit to the mean stack. In particular, for MgII and CIV two
>gaussian with fixed doublet separation and width are fit to the stack. However, no details on the doublet ratio range
>allowed are given. This is particularly important for CIV where the doublets are not well resolved in the stack.
>Consequently, the velocity centroid and doublet ratio will be degenerate and uncertainty due to this degeneracy must
>be addressed.

We thank the referee for pointing out the insufficient detail in the text. The doublet ratio is allowed to vary
between 2:1 to 1:1.

>Major point 4:
>The primary results of the paper are that (1) while the dispersion observed in the stack is large, galactic superwinds
>may not be required to explain the width and (2) the absorption is kinematically offset from the quasar systemic
>redshifts by ~+200 km/s. The authors interpret this offset as due to effects from partial obscuration of the quasar or
>finite quasar lifetimes and light-travel time under the assumption that gas is, on average, flowing away from the
>quasar host. In QPQ VII the CII covering fractions are observed to decrease rapidly from ~80% at projected distances
>of <200 kpc to 20% at 200-500 kpc and <10% at 500-1000 kpc. This rapid fall-off with projected distance suggests that
>the majority of the absorption arises in the quasar host halo. Consequently, motions due to Hubble flow are not likely
>to be significant. Conclusion (2) therefore requires significant outflows in the halo, inconsistent with conclusion
>(1). This discrepancy needs to be addressed in the discussion.

In QPQ8, we have estimated the random incidence of optically thick absorbers. Text has been added to reflect
these numbers. As our Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate, outflows are not required to reproduce the observed
amplitude and dispersion of the mean absorption.

>Major point 5:
>
>Several papers in the literature that are cited are mis-represented in the introduction. In particular:
>
>Johnson et al. 2015 is cited as concluding that the large velocity of absorbing gas observed around quasars is due to
>outflows. This is not the case. The paper considers several possible explanations including large-scale structure,
>galaxy interactions, and outflows. The conclusion of the paper is that none of these possibilities can satisfactorily
>explain the observed properties of cool gas around quasars.
>
>Gauthier et al. 2013, Muzahid 2015, and Zahedy et al. 2016 exhibit velocity spreads of ~600, 300-400, and 600 km/s

>inaccurate statement needs to be clarified and corrected.
>
>These misrepresentations combined with the fact that the paper applies redshift bias corrections from the literature

We thank the referee for clarifying the explanation to Johnson+15's results. We have updated the text to reflect that
outflows is only one possibility. Gauthier+13 is a single sightline, and the velocity width Dv90 of the MgII
absorber is less than the average of QPQ8 CII absorber. Muzahid+15 found an absorber with Dv90 less than 555 km/s in
OVI and NV, and still smaller for other ions. Zahedy+16's sample has average Dv90 smaller than that of QPQ8.

>Minor issues:
>
>Introduction Section:
>
>1) When discussing inflows, the authors should cite Rubin et al. 2012
>2) The definition of h in this paper is not in accordance with the common convention and should be replaced with h_70
>to prevent the casual reader from being confused.
>3) Rudie et al. 2017 should be included in the references for systems with large velocity spread. This paper is
>highly relevant to the discussions in this manuscript.

We have cited Rudie+17 in our revised manuscript. As our focus is on absorbers in background sightlines, Rubin+12 is
less relevant. We intend that h = H_0 / (100 km s^-1 Mpc^-1), in accordance with the common convention, that is also
widely used in cosmology papers such as Kravtsov+17. We have state this scaling explicitly in our revised manuscript.
We thank the referee for above suggestions.


>Experiment Section:
>
>1) Given the anti-correlation between covering fraction and projected distance, the authors may be able to increase
>the S/N in the average absorption profiles by only considering quasars with projected distances of <100 and <200 kpc
>from the background sightline.

We performed the experiment of separating the sightlines into two bins of projected distance. We found the stack of
sightlines below the median projected distance looks similar to the full sample. We did not find a significant boost
in S/N in the average absorption profiles.

>Analysis Section:
>1) The authors claim that it is not necessary to smooth the spectra before linearly interplating onto a 100 km/s
>pixel grid. This may be true for the low-resolution spectra but is untrue for the moderate and high resolution
>spectra used where linear interpolation onto a coarser pixel scale will have unpredictable results. The authors
>should test that this dues not actually change any results.

For each sightline, we overplotted the original absorption profile and that interpolated onto the common velocity
grid, and visually the overplots. We have confirmed to ourselves that the equivalent widths and the shapes of the
absorption profiles are preserved.

>2) The mean redshifted centroid in the CII profile is observed in the mean stack but not the median at a level that
>is in tension. The study does not address this discrepancy and does not provide sufficient reasoning for preferring
>the mean over the median when attempting to measure a centroid.

There is large intrinsic scatter in the CGM environments. In our revised manuscript, we update the sample to pairs
retrieved from the latest QPQ Survey database and we re-measure the redshifts originally adopted from HeWitt&Wild10.
With this sample the median CII statistic has a centroid +119+/-240 km/s. We prefer the mean over the median, as the
median statistic is less sensitive to absorption signals and does not preserve equivalent width. The median opacity at
any velocity channel can be rather small, since absorbers are spread out throughout the entire velocity window and are
discretized. The centroid measured from the median stack is thus subject to larger uncertainty.

>3) It is quite odd that the quoted error in the centroid for the z=1 coadd is 388 km/s, larger than the 161 km/s
>dispersion. What is going on here? In addition, why would a shift be observed for z=2 quasars but not z=1 ones? The
>authors seem to take this as evidence that the redshift in the absorption centroid is real. I came to the opposite
>conclusions since accurate redshifts for low-z quasars are easier to come by.

The quoted uncertainty in the centroid is the standard deviation in the 10000 bootstrap realizations. The average
absorption of this stack is weak, and the measured dispersion too has a large intrinsic scatter. A shift is not
definitively observed in the 0.4 < z < 1.6 stack. It may be due to weaker average absorption, or it may be due to
lower average quasar luminosity should our interpretations be correct. The 0.4 < z < 1.6 quasars are largely SDSS
spectra, and we adopt redshifts taken from Hewett&Wild10, which are dominated by the [OIII] or the MgII emission-line.
The z ~ 2 quasars of our sample have MgII, [OIII], or Halpha emission-line redshifts. We do not consider that the
redshifts of the 0.4 < z < 1.6 quasars are more accurate, since the more precise [OIII] redshifts are only accessible
in SDSS spectral coverage for z < 0.84.

>4) Section 3.4 contributes little to the paper and is redundant with existing work in the literature. The authors may
>wish to remove it to avoid distracting readers.

We have moved this section to the Appendix in our revised manuscript.

>5) Figure 6 may be difficult for color-blind readers to interpret.

We consulted websites for generating color-blindness-friendly figures, and found that our navy color was challenging
for readers with total color-blindness. We have changed that to a brighter shade of blue in our revised manuscript.

Discussion Section:

>1) The paper cites Roos et al. 2015 and Gabor & Bournaud et al. 2014 when discussing quasar emission anisotropy. The
>should add references to observational papers that demonstrate this though polarization measurements and/or
>observations of ionization cones at lower redshifts.

At low z, both symmetric and asymmetric ionization cones around quasars and AGNs are observed. In the extended
emission-line region of 4C37.43, most of the [OIII] emission is blueshifted (Fu&Stockton07), but there are counter
examples in less extended sources in FU&Stockton09. Recently there has been Fabry-Perot velocity fields for less
extended narrow-line regions in more nearby sources (Keel+15,17), which show mostly symmetric velocity fields and gas
distributions.

>2) In the cartoons presented in Figure 8-9, my interpretation is that under this scenario, low ions should be
>redshifted and high ions such as CIV blue-shifted. This is not observed based on the measurements of CIV in Table 2.
>Please clarify and address this apparent contradiction between the observed data and model interpretation.

CIV may be regarded as an intermediate ion, and gas that receives an ionizing radiation from the quasar may be even
more highly ionized. We have access to a Cloudy grid that uses an extragalactic UV background spectral shape as input.
We have verified to ourselves the following. For the typical Lyman limit luminosity of our sample
10^31.5 erg s^-1 Hz^-1, for the average total column density of the QPQ8 sample 10^20.5 cm^-2 and the average [M/H] =
-0.6, at a distance = 150 kpc and density = 0.1 cm^-3, Cloudy predicts that CIV absorption is only marginally
detectable. Moreover, given the large intrinsic scatter, we do not explore whether there exists relative asymmetry
among CII, CIV, and MgII.

>3) Finally, if the authors are aware of any work simulation work demonstrating that gas flows at high-z on these
>scales are primarily outward, they should be discussed. For example, Shen et al. 2012, find significant column
>densities in inflowing gas, particularly at lower ionization states. Of course, this is a lower mass halo, but
>similar insights may be available from simulations of more massive systems.

Faucher-Giguere+16 represents the only simulation so far that is able to reproduce the substantial amount of cool gas
in quasar-mass haloes. Their group has not compared the fraction of gas in inflows and outflows. Furthermore, we
consulted Jared Gabor and we found no more simulation papers that predicted unipolar emission other than the two we
cited.
