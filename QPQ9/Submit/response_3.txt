Dear referee,

We thank you very much for the careful reading and constructive criticism
that will help toward the eventual acceptance for publication.

We thank the referee very much for pushing us to examine our Monte Carlo
simulation outputs. Asymmetric distribution of Hubble velocities alone
cannot produce the observed redshifted centroid. We made a mistake in
our claim in the last response, as we mistook the simulation outputs
that incorporated outflows to be those without outflows. We find that,
with asymmetric distribution in Hubble velocities alone, the centroid
may at most be shifted ~80 km/s. Hence, the observed putative asymmetry
suggests the presence of an outflowing component! We crudely estimate
that, the observed dispersion and centroid may be reproduced with a
quasar opening angle of 120 degrees and radial velocities of 500 km/s.
We added text that justifies ionizing absorbers at Mpc distances from
the quasar. The argument comes from the observed anisotropic clustering
of absorbers around quasars.

We added text about outflows. In addition, we also restructured the text
somewhat to first discuss the observed dispersion and then discuss the
observed centroid. We put a confidence limit on the observed centroid
of the average absorption from CII at 232+/-98 km/s, with large intrinsic
scatter. Hence, we consider it worthwhile to also separately analyze the
observed disperson.

>Remaining major question 2:

>In the Monte Carlo model, the authors adopt a sigma_rms scatter of 246

We thank the referee for this suggestion, that helps strengthen the
results. We try adopting a sigma_rms scatter more more typical of coeval
Lyman break galaxies, for absorbers at cosmological distances. We find
that the dispersion in the model is again consistent with the
observation. Relevant text has been added.

We have added the pseudo-continuum levels to Table 2.

We also added text to quantify the width, amplitude, and uncertainties in
the wider and waeker Gaussian component.

The Mean CII to CII* ratio is 0.2, and we estimate that CII* may at most
add a ~40 km/s positive bias.

In our response to the last report, we overlooked the referee's request
for changing the color scheme of Figure 6, and we had only done that for
the two cartoon figures. We apologize for that, and we have now changed
the color scheme of Figure 6.
