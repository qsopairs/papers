The latest version of the paper addresses my previous questions and
concerns. I have two additional suggestions that could further strengthen
the paper:

1) The paper now states that a 500 km/s outflow can reproduce the
observed velocity shift based on "crude" estimates. Please give a bit
more detail on how this estimate was obtained and state whether it is
degenerate with e.g. the quasar opening angle or episodic lifetime.

2) It would be useful to compare this outflow rate with other works and
discuss possible origins of the putative outflows (e.g. supernovae vs.
AGN). For example, a comparison with Turner+2014, 2017 would be
enlightening. In particulary, Turner+2017 examined mean absorption
optical depths around Lyman break galaxies and compared with simulations.
For lower ionization state gas (HI, SiIV, and CIV in this case), the
favored conclusion is that clustering of the absorption in velocity space
is most consistent with gas that is *inflowing* on average. This is in
apparent contrast with the new conclusions of the paper. This difference
may be related to the masses of the systems being studied or the presence
of the quasar due to quasar driven outflows (e.g. Green+2012) and/or
supernovae driven outflows from starburst activity that is correlated
with the presence of quasars (e.g. Barthel+2017).

A few minor aesthetic points:

1) It would be useful to add minor ticks to Figure 3, particularly on the
x-axis.

2) The numbering on the x-axis of Figure 4 is difficult to read
currently.
