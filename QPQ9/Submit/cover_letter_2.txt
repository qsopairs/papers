Editor Walter,

We thank very much the referee for their careful reading of our
manuscript, and their comments and criticism. Following their
recommendations, we have revised our manuscript in a number of ways
detailed below. We are now resubmitting to the Astrophysical Journal and
ask that you consider it further for publication.

In addition to the changes marked in bold face, Figure 7 and Figure 8 have
been enlarged.

We thank the referee for pointing out the misuse of central limit theorem!
It applies to the fluxes at each pixel. The absorption in the stack will
follow the distribution from which it was sampled, by the law of large
numbers. We present a more careful argument for fitting one Gaussian
component and one constant component, and removed the text relying on the
central limit theorem.

The distribution of absorbers unassociated with the foreground quasars is
expected to be uniform and random, and depress the continuum level in the
stack uniformly. This justifies our fitting of a pseudocontinuum, and is
not the quantity of interest. The questions to be addressed is, whether
one component is a good description of the dispersion in the average
absorption, and if so, whether the dispersion in this component is well
captured by a Gaussian. We tried replacing a constant pseudocontinuum with
a second Gaussian absorption component in our modeling of the CII stack.
We found this second Gaussian component to be weak and broad. The amplitude
is 0.03, compared to our original constant component of 0.97. The standard
deviation is 3600 km/s, whose span is wider than the entire velocity window
for stacking. This weak and very broad component also has little effect on
the centroid and width of the narrower Gaussian component. We therefore see
no convincing evidence for a broader component hidden in the depressed
continuum. We then calculated the dispersion in a +/-1300 km/s window
surrounding the absorption centroidusing the standard deviation formula. We
have this large velocity window to encompass most of the associated
absorption. We found the dispersion measured this way is essentially the
same as that found by fitting a Gaussian. This also leans support to our
approach of fitting two Gaussians to the CIV and MgII doublet, where we
cannot directly apply the standard deviation formula.

In our revised manuscript, we acknowledge the possibility our Gaussian
model does not capture all the powers at extreme velocities. However we
also note that occasional large kinematic offsets do not make a strong case
against gravitational motions. Firstly, quasars occasionally inhabit
extremely overdense environments, such as protoclusters. Secondly, the
probability of intercepting a random absorber is boosted by large scale
clustering. Hence occasional extreme velocities would not necessitate
outflows. Our preferred kinematic measure is thus the dispersion in the
average absorption. We added the above text to the revised manuscript.

The uniformly depressed continuum results from absorbers unrelated to the
foreground quasars, which is expected to have a covering fraction less than
50%. For median stack, a pixel is not affected unless there are more than
50% of quasar pairs with absorption at its velocity. The pseudo-continuum
of the mean stack being lower than the median stack is not a reflection of
associated absorption at large velocities.

We tried fitting the continuum separately in (-3000,-1300) km/s and (+1300,
+3000) km/s instead of multiplying a constant to a Gaussian. We found the
continuum determined this way is essentially the same.

We acknowledge the degeneracy between the centroid and the doublet ratio
for CIV. And hence, we state that the results for the doublets are
presented for consistency check, but the analysis focuses on CII. We
emphasized this point in the revised manuscript. For CIV, a doublet ratio
closer 2:1 is preferred. We found a doublet ratio of 2:1 captures the
absorption at the central few pixels better than a doublet ratio of 1:1
does.

>=== Main concern 3: mis-representation of papers in the literature

>While most of these have been corrected, one remains and a new one has

We identified and excluded all spectra with BAL and mini-BAL systems.
Possible contamination from narrow associated absorbers of background
quasars should result in a tilt in the pseudo-continuum. Associated
absorbers of background quasars will not prefer the systemic velocity of
the foreground quasars, and hence will not affect the average absorption
measured for the foreground quasars. The median pair velocity separation
of the CII sample is 11140 km/s. Dividing the sample ino two bins of pair
velocity separation does not result in meaningful comparison, due to the
smaller number of pairs in each bin. Hwever we see no evidence for a
difference in the centroid's redshift of the two bins.

We examined all the nine CII-bearing subsystems in QPQ8 where CII* is not
blended with CII. Among the above nine subsystems, only one, J1420
subsystem F, has CII* equivalent width comparable to CII. Hence,
contamination from CII* is insignifcant and could not be responsible for
the observed shift. We thank the referee for suggesting us to add this to
the text.

>B) To demonstrate that the quasar variability effect can plausibly
>produce the observed shift from Hubble flow alone the authors need to
>calculate the distance to which the quasars can substantially contribute
>to the UV background and convert this distance to a line-of-sight
>velocity assuming Hubble flow. Most of the work for this has already been
>done for the calculation of g_UV for Figure 1 and Table 1 so only a few
>additional steps are needed. Implementing this calculation in the Monte
>Carlo approach in Section 3.3 would be particularly convincing.

In our test of implementing an arbitrary quasar opening angle in our Monte
Carlo simulations to reproduce the observed shift, we remove all absorbers
at CGM distances that fall within the opening angle to mimic UV
enhancement. We did not remove absorbers at larger distances/Hubble flow
velocities as the effect of quasar variability is expected to be weaker.
However, for the stack of mock spectra fro Monte Carlo simulations that we
present in Figure 5, we did not include this quasar variability effect but
merely shifted the absorption centroid to match with the observations. The
goal of Figure 5 is to show that the observed velocity width can be
reproduced without outflows. Introducing quasar variability would
introduce more free parameters and the figure may be less informative.

>C) To clarify the discussion the authors should:
>1) Rephrase or expand the sentence/paragraph: "As a test of
>reasonableness, we calculate that, for a quasar opening angle of 120...".
>It is not clear what calculation was performed and how it represents a
>test of reasonableness.
>2) Remove the sentence "Light from the background quasar will travel
>smaller  distance to reach the gas behind the foreground quasar than the
>gas in front of it." It is repetitive and the subsequent sentence
>explains this physical picture more clearly.
>3) The last sentence of the paper is misleading because the observed
>velocity shift cannot be explained by gravitational motion.

We expanded the text on the test of an arbitrary, reasonable quasar
opening angle. In this test, we removed all CGM absorbers that fall
within the quasar opening angle in our Monte Carlo simulations. We found
that for an opening angle of 120 degrees, the observed centroid may be
reproduced while the intrinsic dispersion is still wthin the modeling
error.
We removed the sentence "Light from the background quasar will travel..."
as the referee suggested. This indeed helps clear up the test.
We rewrote the last sentence to separately provide the explanation for
the large velocity widths and the explanation for the average shift.

>Finally, I would like to thank the authors for going the extra mile and
>researching color choices that improve figure legibility for color blind
>readers. However, the stated change does not appear to have been
>implemented in Figure 6. Since the work has already been done,
>implementing the color change would be an easy correction.

We examined the cartoon figures again. A lighter shade of blue instead
of navy had been used for the CIV ions. It seems the poor legibility also
came from the figures being too compact. We enlarged the figures in the
revised manuscript. We are very happy to use another color scheme should
the referee or editor have better suggestion.
