monte_carlo.ipynb: interactive notebook for step-by-step running of monte
carlo simulations for QSO-absorber clustering. Similar to
py/monte_carlo.py .

New_continua.ipynb: interactively generate new continua that are not in
igmspec or the QPQ database, or update with more accurate continuum
fitting.

New_sample.ipynb: generate the QPQ9 sample step by step. Replacing the
deprecated QPQ9_sample_deprecated.ipynb notebook. gUV values are computed
using the IDL procedures g_uv.pro and cldy_cuba_jfh.pro, with wrappers
under the folder pro/. Input files to IDL and output files from IDL are
created in New_sample.ipynb, and are saved as QPQ9_gUV_idl_input.txt and
QPQ9_gUV_idl_output.txt .

QPQ9_stacking.ipynb: Stack the QPQ9 sample at different ions, with
different cuts on emission line redshift precision.
