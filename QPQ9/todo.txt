1. Stack in QPQ7 of the metal lines that used only MgII redshifts? 
  That should have yielded the asymmetry that we are seeing in QPQ8. 
	2. Re-run with vdiff criterion = 200 km/s and PK2C = 0.25
3. Double check zQA [Joe+Marie]
4. Worry about mean-flux-regulation
5. Deal with bad continua
6. Color code individual systems in stacks by Rperp
7. Make CII+CIV stacks with MgII redshifts
	8. Cut CII and other metals to be outside the forest
9. Get Q0814 in the sample?
	10. Check sample size for CII 1334
11. Worry about 0 velocity pixel (right or left or neither??)
12. [OIII] cut or Ha/Hb cut or MgII cut?!
13. Continuum fit: ESI SDSSJ142004.12+022708.8_F.fits.gz
14. Figure out small velocity offset in binned evaluation (to the blue)
